Create new web projects really fast. By  giving Pipe Dream a minimum of input in form of a sketch/entity list it will predict your application schema and feed it into a set of pipes. These pipes will generate all the files needed to get started really quick.

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev pipe-dream/laravel-create
```
```bash
php artisan pipedream:build
```

Thats it, now open your browser and go to `/pipe-dream` and start designing.

## Usage
If you havent already, [watch the 2 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doUlmZdvP1o).

* List your models and tables in the sketch window. Note the schema is created in real-time and is being displayed on the right side of the screen.

* Here are some pointers on the sketch syntax
```js
// use PascalCase for models
Garage
location
capacity

// Separate your entities into chunks
Car
color
user_id // foreign key

// use snake_case model1_model2 to setup a ManyToMany relationship
car_garage 

// use button to add a default user system
User 
name
email
email_verified_at
password
remember_token

// use snake_case to create a table
password_resets
email
token
```

 * Review the list of files that are going to be created.

<kbd><img src="src/public/img/screenshots/review.png" /></kbd>

* Commit the files to disk.

* You are now ready to migrate and seed. Go ahead and check out the API (at `/api`), that contains placeholder values
